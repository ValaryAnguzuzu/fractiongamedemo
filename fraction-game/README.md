# Fraction Comparison Game (React + Vite Demo)

This is a **demo project** built using **React + Vite (JavaScript)** to explore an educational math game concept designed for children learning **fractions**.

### Core Idea

Players are dealt 3 random **fraction cards**. A virtual **spinner** (represented by a button) randomly selects a comparison operator like `>`, `<`, `=`. The player must choose one of their cards that satisfies the condition. Itâ€™s meant to be quick, fun, and reinforce fraction comparison skills in an engaging way.

>  This is a **minimal prototype** that demonstrates:
> - Card generation
> - Spinner logic using a button
> - Simple card selection
> - Feedback on correct or incorrect choice  
>
>  Future versions may include:
> - Animated spinner or wheel
> - Audio effects and feedback
> - Score tracking across multiple rounds
> - Visual fraction representation (like pie charts or number lines)
> - Adaptive difficulty for learning progression
